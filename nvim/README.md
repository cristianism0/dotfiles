# Dotfiles NVIM

For LSP you will need `npm` package tool from Node.js.

For this, we will use `NVM`, a Node.js version manager, and use it on our path.

[Here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for documentation.

Or, follow those steps:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
```

Update shell:
```bash
souce ~/.bashrc
```

Look for nvm versions: 
```bash
nvm remote list
```

Install:
```bash
nvm install xx.xx.xx
```

Check if `npm` is installed:
```bash
which npm
```
